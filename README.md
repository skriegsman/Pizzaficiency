# Pizzaficiency
Pizzaficiency will show you the fastest and/or cheapest pizza near you

---
## Inspiration
Our good friend Saad has come with us to every hackathon. This weekend however he wasn't able to come because he has been missing to many weekend shifts at dominos. We wanted to make something pizza related that could help people to more efficiently obtain these delicious cheese covered triangles in honor of Saad.
## What it does
This website allows users to enter in their location and then choose to either find the cheapest pizza within a reasonable distance of them or the fastest pizza A.K.A the closest pizza to them.

Where I live the closest pizza place is a Sbarro's located in a rest stop by the turnpike. If I am in desperate need of cheesy pepperoni goodness and I need it now, I can go there.

If I have a bit more time but I want to save money then I can choose the cheapest pizza option and the website will suggest the pizza place and pizza size that has the lowest cost per square inch of pizza.
